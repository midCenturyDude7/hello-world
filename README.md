Getting started with Solidity -- June 25, 2018

Hello fellow blockchain nerds/enthusiasts. I'm interested in making this whole blockchain obsession of mine more than a passing interest. I am attempting to learn Solidity with very little programming experience other than a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Tall order it will be, but I am determined to stick with it and learn as much as I can. 

All best,
Matt Griffes
